# ThrownForALoop

## Column one in Foundations book. 

while this is a public repo, it is soley for documentation of my work and learning through Thrown for a loop, in the C# curriculum

### Here is what I am learning so far. 
1. declaring variables with strong types
1. string interpolation
1. `if`/`else`, `while`, (`for` and `foreach` will be covered later)
1. `false` in C# vs. 'falsy' in JS
1. string methods: `IsNullOrWhiteSpace`, `IsNullOrEmpty`, `Trim`
